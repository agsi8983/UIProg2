## Delimitations
The current implementation has a few delimitations and one known bug. 
* There is only one maze available. 
* The cat moves randomly to adjacent cells.
* There are no available settings, for instance it is not possible to turn off the chewing sound or change the color mode.
* The bug is that it is sometimes possible to collide with the cat for more than one time before game over.
